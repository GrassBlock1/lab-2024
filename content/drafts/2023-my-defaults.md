# Introduction
As far as I concerned, the choices of software based on a certain intention are always a headache for everyone, since there are just so many choices, and it's hard to make a decision.

Take the writing (or extend it to note-taking apps, etc.) apps for example. Apps like [Pure Writer](https://writer.drakeet.com/) , [Typora](https://typora.io/) and things like Notion are popular among the community. For developers who simply want to writing things while coding, he/she can just create a file and use IDEs that they are familiar with. Or just the notepad.exe on every Windows users' desktop is waiting for you if you want to (although it sucks).

But after a long time of trying, You and I finally got used to a set of apps that we are satisfied with. And we call it "defaults".

These days,  we can always see people sharing their defaults on the Internet, and the debates on them unavoidably appear on the comment section(or something like these).

As a saying goes, "You have your way. I have my way. As for the right way, the correct way, and the only way, it does not exist."([src](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/individuality)). The defaults vary from person to person, and choosing the right defaults is a long-term process. The war is endless.

About 2 weeks ago, I saw a Telegram recommending Robb's [App Defaults](https://defaults.rknight.me/) project, so I decided to join the "duel" and share my defaults. Anyway, you can find out what apps other people mainly use by clicking the link, or subscribe [its RSS feed](https://defaults.rknight.me/feed.xml) to get updates.;D

Before I start, I want to say that I'm not a professional developer or blogger, I'm just a student who is interested in these things. So, if you have any suggestions to make things better, please feel free to leave a comment below. I'll be very grateful for that.

Here we go! 

# My Defaults
## Writing
- **IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate**: Sounds a little bit weird, but I have been using it to write several posts with that. It's not that bad, and everything I need is just there. As I use [Hexo](https://hexo.io) for blogging, what I really would like to know is what the post will look like before publishing it. Thanks to the debugging feature of IntelliJ IDEA, I can preview the post in the browser with just one click. And the built-in Git support is also a plus.(though I would say its support on Linux is not that good, like the HiDPI support, etc.)
- **Apostrophe**: Developed by GNOME community, Apostrophe is a simple and elegant Markdown editor. Apart from opening and editing Markdown files, sometimes I also use it for writing some drafts. 
- **Notion**
